Ramazan Ali Hassani,03:09.8,"Has a car with which he moves around and makes the effort to find the beneficiary households; The door tags seem legit and the GPS points captured accurately but in some instances, finds the house of  the beneficiary that is externally verified but completes their form in a different location (mostly in or around community elder's residence), which is why some GPS points are very close.; 

In 4 instances, makes false promises to the respondents; skips some questions and inputs made-up answers in some instances; More than 80 percent of the data is externally verified, and all in  written format with the same text: ""The beneficiary has gone out of the village for work.""' No useful information can be obtained from the AA of the externally verified data;
